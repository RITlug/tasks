Real-life issue tracker for tasks, goals, and objectives for RITlug


## About

This is a real-life issue tracker for RITlug. No code lives in this repository,
but it's a place to keep track of information and tasks that need to get done
at RITlug. You can find these tasks and tickets in the form of GitHub issues
[here](https://github.com/RITlug/tasks/issues "See what RITlug is up to").

**These are open for everyone!** The RITlug Eboard primarily uses this for
planning and keeping track of what needs to be done, but any club or community
member is welcome to participate and add their voice. You're also welcome to
file your issues too.


## Labels

Labels are used to help understand the priority or type of task that an issue
is about. All issues should be tagged accordingly and also be used with a
milestone, if there are other issues that should be complete by a certain date.
A quick reference of some common ones is included here:

* **Priorities**:
  * _priority/low_: Low priority, isn't a primary focus
  * _priority/medium_: Normal priority, something to be done soon
  * _priority/high_: High priority, something to be done ASAP by next meeting
* **Task status**:
  * _in progress_: Task that is currently in progress
  * _needs feedback_: Something that needs feedback from Eboard or others
  * _blocked_: Task that is blocked until something else is resolved first
* **Task type**:
  * _information_: Related to communicating key club information
  * _Eboard_: Exclusively for executive board members to address
  * _meeting_: Related to RITlug meetings
  * _easyfix_: An easier task that's great for someone looking to help out
